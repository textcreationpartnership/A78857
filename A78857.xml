         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WORTHY SPEECH Spoken by Sir VVILLIAM WROTH unto the Houſe of Commons, Concerning His <hi>Majeſties Letter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis Letter, or Declaration now read from His ſacred Maieſtie, expreſſing His Princely care, and tender affection towards the Parliament, and all His Maiſties loyall and dutifull Subiects, is now to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Our Conſideration: And I verily beleeve there is none here preſent, but hath as tender care and dutifull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards His Royall Maieſtie, and the preſervation of His Honour and Dignity, the Lawes and Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in His Maieſties Dominions, Parliaments, and their iuſt rights and Priviledges, as any ſubiects to any Prince in the whole Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>No man, M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I thinke doubted, or had the leaſt thought of iealouſie (that are true Proteſtants and Loyall Subiects) of His Maieſties ſincerity, and integrity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards His Liege People: For we have ſenſibly felt, and underſtood His Cleare Intentions, and Gracious meaning to us all; not onely theſe His Princely expreſſions in this His Gracious Letter, and Declaration, but alſo by former Speeches, Proclamations, and Proteſtations, both Publique, and Private; His willing and cheerefull
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155753:4"/> granting us from time to time, our iuſt deſires, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and His cheerefull paſſing of many wholeſome Acts and Lawes for the good of this Kingdome, and the redreſſing of many grievances and oppreſſions, which His good Subiects did ſuffer, by groaning under the burden of them; and His willing Complying with His Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the appeaſing of the great Differences that was betweene this Kingdome, and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and (wee hope) the ſetling of Peace, and amity amongſt our ſelves (which God graunt.) Theſe have beene ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of His Princely and tender Care over His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and enough to endeare our hearts and affections to His Royall Maieſty, and His Poſterity forever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Speaker,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Propoſitions recommended by His Maieſty to the Conſideration of the Houſe conſiſts of theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>The upholding and maintaining of His Maieſties iuſt and Regall Authority, and ſetling of His Revenue, and the eſtabliſhing of the Liberties of the Subiect, in the free and quiet enioying of their eſtates and fortunes, the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their perſons, the ſecurity of true Religion, now profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſetling of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in ſuch a manner, as may take away all iuſt offence.</p>
            <p>1 For the firſt of theſe, it hath beene our Principall Care, and endeavours hitherto, as farre as the preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and diſtractions in the State would give us leave, to maintaine the iuſt Prerogative, and Regall Power of His Maieſtie, and to ſettle His Revenue. But being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to conſult, and conſider of the great and weighty Affaires of this State, being ſo perplexed, and diſtracted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155753:4"/> through the malice and pernicious endeavours of wicked and diſ-affected perſons, to the Peace and Tranquillity both of His Maieſty, and His Kingdomes, thereby forced to lay aſide the Determinations of His Maieſties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, till His Maieſties Kingdomes be ſecured, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from fatall deſtruction, which by the malignant Adverſaries thereof, dayly ſought and practiſed: but not leaving the ſame, either as negligent, or forgetfull of His Maieſties iuſt Demands, or in any undutifulneſſe, but that in due time, upon the firſt opportunity to take the ſame againe into Conſideration, and proceede therein to the finall concluſion thereof; deſiring this Houſe that His Maieſty may be informed of our reall intentions therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the other Propoſition by his Maieſtie, wee cannot but in dutifull obedience returne our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to his Maieſtie in the Name of the whole Parliament, for his Princely Care of our Liberties and Priviledges, and Pious Reſolution to eſtabliſh our Religion in its Truth and Puritie, and his indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie in the uſe and exerciſe of Ceremonies; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, wee have received many Petitions from divers Counties and parts of this Kingdome, ſigned with many thouſand Hands, for the utter aboliſhment of the ſame: ſhewing likewiſe the inconvenience in the uſe and exerciſe of the ſame, the great Dammage and many Evils that have ſucceeded upon the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof hitherto; which, with the continuance of the uſe thereof, is alſo like to continue the Evils, and dayly encreaſe more and more d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which Lets and Hinderances, which have cauſed theſe Stops, in our Proceedings in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Religion, I likewiſe deſire may be repreſented to his Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning his Maieſties Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which I deſire may be taken into preſent Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and Anſwer returned to his Maieſtie concerning the ſame.</p>
